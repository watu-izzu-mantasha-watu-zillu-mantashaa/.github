**قُلِ اللَّهُمَّ مَالِكَ الْمُلْكِ تُؤْتِي الْمُلْكَ مَن تَشَاءُ، وَتَنزِعُ الْمُلْكَ مِمَّن تَشَاءُ، وَتُعِزُّ مَن تَشَاءُ، وَتُذِلُّ مَن تَشَاءُ، بِيَدِكَ الْخَيْرُ، إِنَّكَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ**

## English Translation:

“Say: O Allah, Owner of the Kingdom, You give kingdom to whom You will, and You take away the kingdom from whom You will. You honor whom You will, and You humiliate whom You will. In Your Hand is all good. Indeed, You are Able to do all things.”  
— *Surah Aal-e-Imran (3:26)*

## Urdu Translation:

**کہہ دیجئے: اے اللہ! بادشاہی کے مالک! تو جسے چاہے بادشاہی دے دے اور جس سے چاہے بادشاہی چھین لے، اور جسے چاہے عزت دے اور جسے چاہے ذلت دے، سب بھلائی تیرے ہی ہاتھ میں ہے۔ بے شک تو ہر چیز پر قادر ہے۔**

## Breakdown of the Key Segment:

### 1. Watu Izzu Mantasha – *"You Honor Whom You Will"*

Allah gives **‘izzah** (honor, dignity, strength) to whom He wills. No matter how weak someone appears in the eyes of the world, if Allah wants to honor them, no one can stop it.


- **Personal Reflection**: I’ve seen people rise from nothing to everything simply because of Allah’s favor. Not because of wealth or status, but because of inner strength and barakah.

---

### 2. Watu Zillu Mantasha – *"You Humiliate Whom You Will"*

Likewise, Allah can bring down even the mightiest. Power and pride don’t last if they’re not used with humility and gratitude.

- **Related Words**: downfall, disgrace, humility, divine justice
- **Example**: Think of the Pharaoh who once claimed to be a god. Allah humbled him in the most dramatic way—drowned in the very sea he thought he controlled.

## Spiritual Lessons from the Verse

### 1. Nothing is Permanent

Leadership, power, wealth, and even people’s respect—none of it is permanent. They come and go according to Allah’s wisdom.

### 2. Stay Humble and Grateful

When Allah gives you honor, don’t let arrogance grow. And when you're tested with loss or humiliation, remember it may just be your path to greater spiritual strength.

### 3. Trust in Allah’s Plan

We often chase after status and respect, but this verse reminds us that true *izzah* only comes from Allah. So, don’t despair if you're ignored by people—seek honor from the One who truly controls it.

## Tafsir Insights from Authentic Sources

### Tafsir Ibn Kathir:

According to Ibn Kathir, this verse shows that Allah is the sole authority over worldly and spiritual affairs. He elevates whomever He wills with faith and righteous actions and humiliates those who turn away from His path.

### Hadith Reference:

The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:  
> **“Whoever humbles himself for the sake of Allah, Allah will raise him.”**  
> *(Sahih Muslim)*

This reflects the theme of the verse: humility leads to honor, and arrogance leads to downfall.

## Practical Applications in Life

- **When You Feel Unseen:** Remember, your worth isn’t in likes, promotions, or praise. It’s in how Allah sees you.  
- **During Success:** Don’t forget where the success came from. Say *Alhamdulillah* and be grateful.  
- **In Times of Loss:** Know that Allah has better plans. This verse assures that even disgrace can be a door to closeness with Him.

It’s a verse of complete surrender. It teaches us to rely only on Allah. If you feel you’ve been wronged or are longing for success, recite this verse in your duas. Ask Allah for *izzah* that lasts and protection from disgrace.

This verse isn’t just about kings or leaders. It’s about you and me—ordinary people navigating life’s ups and downs. *Watu izzu mantasha watu zillu mantasha* reminds us that Allah sees us, hears us, and holds our destiny in His hands. That’s not just comforting—it’s empowering.
